 # Async Subdomain Checker Tool

 Through "http:/localhost:8080/domain/status/[domainName]" route
 it sends GET-HTTP request to underlying 3-rd part API "https://sonar.omnisint.io/subdomains/[root]",
 in order to get response body which contains all subdomains of [domainName] domain",
 and after that in asynchronous way using goroutines it calls http.Get(someSubdomain) on each subdomain and
 checks its global availability (e.g whether we are able to reach the server by address or not)
 and sends JSON as response to the same route.
 JSON response is array of results.
